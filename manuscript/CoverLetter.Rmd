Dear Stephen, 
\vspace{2truemm}
  
I am pleased to be submitting *Empirical seed transfer zones require conventions for data sharing to increase* (running title *eSTZ conventions*) for consideration to Restoration Ecology as an opinion piece. 
Please note that both authors are also eligible as RE-New opinion article authors. 

\vspace{3truemm}  

In this piece, we briefly discuss the results from analysing critical aspects of file naming, directory structure, and other attributes of spatial data products associated with empirical seed transfer zone products (eSTZs). 
Upon consideration of current conventions, and best practices for data management, we recommend a set of standards to unify the reporting of eSTZs going forwards. 
In our professional work we have seen rather considerable confusion arise to differences which exist in existing products, and can assure you that these standardizations are badly needed. 
To assist in the implementation of them we have developed a well documented R package which implements essentially every suggestion.

In regards to suggested reviewers please note I have some considerations to voice which would have been included in a comment box if it had been available. 
Regarding Rob Massatti, both authors have sent him hundreds of leaf samples for genetic analysis, as well as numerous seed collections; this was on work we were funded to perform by the Bureau of Land Management. 
We are familiar by name recognition. 
Both myself, R.C. Johnson and Beth Leger are members of the National Intragency Seed and Restoration Center (NISRC) working group. 
I anticipate no issues with this. 
Note that a data set R.C. and Beth developed is used as the sample data for the associated R package. 

\vspace{3truemm}

We have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Please address any correspondence regarding this manuscript to me via the email provided.
