Hey Coel, 

Thanks for clarifying. First off, CONGRATULATIONS on the intership to full time opportunity - that's amazing! I am interested in better understanding the culture at BCGX and projects which they pursue and think the insights from your intership would capture those quite well. I would also be generally intersted in what projects you are working on for school etc. - I've been hearing more about AI/ML engineer roles, but I am bit hazy on the specifics.  

Maybe we could do a 15 minute to half hour chat on Zoom - or if you are up for it (or rather have the time),  meet up for a coffee somewhere? I'm in Rogers Park (near Morse). 

Cheers, 
Reed
